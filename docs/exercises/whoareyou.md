# Who are you?

### What:
This exercise serves as a unique opportunity for team members to foster openness and possibly unveil vulnerabilities. While it may resemble a round-robin session or even an intervention, when handled appropriately, it becomes a powerful team-building exercise.

### Why:
In the workplace environment, this exercise presents a rare chance to delve into personal aspects beyond the professional facade. It offers the team valuable insights into each member's background, family, and life challenges. These are conversations typically kept private, and by sharing them, team members demonstrate a significant level of trust.

### How:
The exercise comprises four thought-provoking questions. It's advisable to notify the team in advance, possibly through email, allowing them time to reflect on the questions and decide how much they are willing to share.

On the event day, ensure a quiet and private setting. As the team leader, take the initiative to go first, setting the tone for the exercise. Emphasise that participation is not mandatory, and individuals can disclose as much or as little as they are comfortable with, with the only requirement being professionalism.

##### Questions:
* Where were you born?
* How many siblings do you have?
* What was the most challenging aspect of your upbringing?
* What do you consider your greatest achievement?

### Tips:
* Treat the questions as conversation starters, with the understanding that individuals have the right to refrain from answering or move on if they prefer.
* Acknowledge that emotions may surface during the session, and having tissues on hand can be beneficial for those who find the experience particularly moving.

### Resources/Inspiration:
* This inspiration for this exercise came from the book [The 5 dysfunction of a team](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Lencioni/dp/0787960756/ref=asc_df_0787960756/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=310737150369&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=16234013471794083983&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1006907&hvtargid=pla-487653304767&psc=1&mcid=1c4d9eddeeed3c5da054f5e5af6f0f27)

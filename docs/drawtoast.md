# Draw Toast

### What:
Tom Wujec, the originator of this engaging exercise, provides an in-depth explanation in his insightful 8-minute TED talk [Watch The Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/tom_wujec_got_a_wicked_problem_first_tell_me_how_you_make_toast?hasSummary=true&language=en).

### Why:
This seemingly simple task – drawing how to make toast – uncovers diverse perspectives within a technical team. The exercise reveals how individuals approach problem-solving, from detailed considerations like the origin of bread grain to more casual mentions of a quick trip to the shops. The true value lies in fostering teamwork and consensus-building, even in a seemingly lighthearted context.

### How:
* Present the problem 'How do you make toast?' 
* Instruct participants to illustrate the process of making toast using images only.
* Allow around 20 minutes for sketching instructions.
* Utilise Post-It-Notes: Request each step of the toast-making process to be written on a note.
* **Team presentations**: Each member posts their process on the wall and explains their approach.
* **Discussion**: After all presentations, discuss common themes and outliers.
* **Consensus-building**: The team's final task is to agree on a unified process for making toast, incorporating everyone's input.

### Tips:
Encourage creativity and diverse perspectives during the sketching phase.
Emphasise active listening during team presentations to understand varying viewpoints.
Use this exercise as an opportunity for team members to appreciate different problem-solving styles.
